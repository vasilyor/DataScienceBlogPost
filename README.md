2. [Project Objectives](#objectives)
3. [File Descriptions](#files)



## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The project is using the following Python Libraries Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn

The code should run using Python versions 3.*

## Project Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

Get hands on practice with few datasets from www.kaggle.com. By looking at the columns we can get tons of questions. I will go over 3 question and find the answers using CRISP-DM Process. The same process should be able to answer more questions and differnt datasets.

**Question1:** Where is more expensive - Boston or Seattle go on vacation

**Question2:** What are the busiest days and what time is best to go - more rental options

**Question3:** Create model for rental price prediction

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions and also a blogpost.

This notebook contains the code and analysis for two datasets using CRISP-DM metodology.
